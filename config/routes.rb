  # The priority is based upon order of creation: first created -> highest priority.
  # See how all your routes lay out with "rake routes".

  # You can have the root of your site routed with "root"
  root 'users#index'

  # Example of regular route:
  #   get 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'
      get 'dispensaries/random_dispensaries' => 'dispensaries#random_dispensaries'
        get '/login' => 'users#login'
        put '/login' => 'users#update'
        get '/signup' => 'users#signup'
        post '/signup' => 'users#create'
  # Example of named route that can be invoked with purchase_url(id: product.id)
  #   get 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', as: :purchase

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   resources :products

  # Example resource route with options:
    resources :dispensaries do
        resources :dispensary_ratings
        resources :dispensary_strains
    end

  # Example resource route with sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales
  #     resource :seller
  #   end

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments
  #     resources :sales do
  #       get 'recent', on: :collection
  #     end
  #   end

  # Example resource route with concerns:
  #   concern :toggleable do
  #     post 'toggle'
  #   end
  #   resources :posts, concerns: :toggleable
  #   resources :photos, concerns: :toggleable


end
